# Overcome your weaknesses. Become the sigma developer.

I grew tired of being humiliated by browser styling. I maintained systems that served hundreds of rps, but doing frontend without design system libraries, it is maddening. I could spend a day working on a signup form and feel miserable, only adding text transform and tweaking i18n. But no more.

This commit proves my resolve as I paid for a CSS course. Own moneys. This is my manifesto of becoming decent at the front-end of front ends.

This repository is a journal from the ["Modern CSS for Backend Developer"](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-css-for-backend-developers) course. I'll keep the sources nicely organised with notes (hopefully). If you'd also like to become the best styled BE dev in your org but don't have the guts to pay for a front-end course (I feel guilty still), maybe this will get you someplace.

> The course seems very nice though, got me sold on the #1 lesson.
